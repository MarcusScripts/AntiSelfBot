Tired of SelfBot users doing illgeal stuff in your Discord server? Well.. I have a file for you which would ease your life..
Please do know that there might be false positives, you must manage the CONFIG yourself which would best suit your server.. But also remember that false positives can be true positives, because everyone lies.
Also create the node_modules, etc yourself.. Simply google it or look at a YouTube video, It's not hard.
